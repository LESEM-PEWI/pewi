PE/WI - People in Ecosystems / Watershed Integration
====
We are accepting pull requests!

PE/WI is a simple web-based educational game designed to assist people in multidimensional land-use decision-making. Players iteratively manipulate land cover annually for three years in a virtual 6000 acre watershed to design land use that meets their perceptions and goals for a well-functioning agricultural landscape. The model computes a variety of outputs, including nutrient pollution, stream sediment delivery, level of biodiversity, and agricultural production, which assist them in landscape design.
